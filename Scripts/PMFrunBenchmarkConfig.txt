# How to use config file:
# Denotes a comment that will be ignored
# \<X> means that now some set of config stuff is defined until the next line starting with \ happens
# \I <NAME> means that the following lines will be added to instance set <NAME>
# For instances it is assumed that they are in the Data folder and the path will automatically be set to support this assumption
# Instance names should not have a file ending. Instances are assumed to be in binary format
# \A <NAME> means that the following lines will be added to the algorithm set <NAME>
# \E <NAME> means that the following lines will be added to the epsilon values set <NAME>
# \R <NAME> means that a run is defined. It must be followed by 3 lines which are interpreted as follows
#   1. the names of all instance sets to be used separated by space
#   2. the names of all algorithm sets to be run separated by space
#   3. the names of all epsilon sets to be run separated by space
# Output will be placed in Data/Output/<ALGO>.csv
# TODO the csv files currently do not get headers. Consider adding this automated
